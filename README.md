# Group Structure in Code

## Project Overview

This project is an integrated framework to represent the structure of finite groups in code. The project's foundation is a custom data structure to represent groups digitally, and its ultimate result is a generalized function for the semidirect product, which can represent almost any group (abelian or not) as a combination of cyclic groups. The project also includes functions to automatically find all possible generators (or generator bases for non-cyclic groups) of a group, find all possible homomorphisms between two given groups, and find the automorphism group of a given group.
